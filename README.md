📊 Basketball Stats Data Analysis using NumPy & Pandas
This project demonstrates key Python data manipulation techniques using NumPy and Pandas, divided into three structured units based on a data science curriculum. The dataset used contains detailed player statistics such as assists, turnovers, rebounds, and more, sourced from Kaggle.

📦 Dataset Used
File: assists-turnovers.csv

Contains NBA player stats with columns like Assists, Turnovers, Rebounds, Player, Team, and more.

🧠 UNIT I – NumPy Essentials
Covers core NumPy operations:

Data types and fixed-type arrays

Creating and reshaping arrays

Indexing, slicing, and broadcasting

Array concatenation and splitting

Universal functions (ufuncs) like np.add, np.mean, etc.

Aggregations and comparisons

Boolean masks and fancy indexing

Sorting with np.sort and np.argsort

Partial sorting (np.partition)

Structured arrays with compound data types

🔍 These concepts help build a strong foundation in fast, vectorized numerical computation.

📈 UNIT II – Pandas Fundamentals
Introduces the power of Pandas:

Creating and working with Series and DataFrame objects

Data selection, indexing, and filtering

Null value detection and handling (isnull(), fillna(), etc.)

Alignment of indexes during operations

Operations between Series and DataFrames

Hierarchical (MultiIndex) indexing

🛠 These tools are essential for cleaning and preparing datasets for deeper analysis.

🔗 UNIT III – Combining & Aggregating Datasets
Demonstrates advanced data manipulation:

Merging and joining datasets (inner, outer, left, right joins)

Concatenation and appending rows

Grouping by team or player and performing aggregations (sum, mean)

Creating Pivot Tables for multi-dimensional summaries

Performing multi-aggregation statistics with agg() and pivot_table()
